\TYPE {match : (term -> term -> ((term # term) list # (type # type) list))}

\SYNOPSIS
Finds instantiations to match one term to another.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to two terms, with no outer quantifiers in the first, {match}
attempts to find type and term instantiations for the first term (only) to make
it match the second. If it succeeds, it returns the instantiations in the form
of a pair containing a list of term replacements and a list of type
instantiations. If the first term represents the conclusion of a theorem, the
returned instantiations are of the appropriate form to be passed to
{INST_TY_TERM}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the term cannot be matched by one-way instantiation.

\EXAMPLE
The following shows how {match} could be used to match the conclusion of a
theorem to a term.
{
   #let th = REFL "x:*";;
   th = |- x = x

   #match (concl th) "1 = 1";;
   ([("1", "x")], [(":num", ":*")])
   : ((term # term) list # (type # type) list)

   #INST_TY_TERM it th;;
   |- 1 = 1
}
\COMMENTS
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned instantiations will be
possible for {INST_TY_TERM} to achieve, because some of the variables (term or
type) which need to be instantiated may be free in the assumptions, eg:
{
   #top_print print_all_thm;;
   - : (thm -> void)

   #let th = ASSUME "x:* = x";;
   th = x = x |- x = x

   #match (concl th) "1 = 1";;
   ([("1", "x")], [(":num", ":*")])
   : ((term # term) list # (type # type) list)

   #INST_TY_TERM it th;;
   evaluation failed     INST_TYPE: type variable free in assumptions
}
\noindent In fact, for instantiating a theorem, {PART_MATCH} is usually easier.

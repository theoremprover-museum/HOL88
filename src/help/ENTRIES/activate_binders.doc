\DOC activate_binders

\TYPE {activate_binders : (string -> string list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes the quotation parser treat all binders in the current theory segment as
such.

\DESCRIBE
The call
{
   activate_binders `thy`
}
\noindent where {thy} is an ancestor theory ({`-`} stands for the current
theory), will return a list of all binders on that theory, and make the parser
treat them all as binders, that is, for each binder {b}, will allow the
syntactic sugaring {"b x. y"} as a shorthand for {"b (\x. y)"}. The special
syntactic status may be suppressed by preceding {b} with a dollar sign. The
function returns a list of all the binders dealt with.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
This function is mainly intended for internal use. All binders declared by
{new_binder} or {new_binder_definition} are always parsed as such anyway.

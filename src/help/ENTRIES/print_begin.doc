\TYPE {print_begin : (int -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Initiates a pretty printing block.

\DESCRIBE
The function {print_begin} initiates a consistent printing block. Consistent
breaks cause uniform indentation at each break. This means that if a list is
printed and the total list is wider than the margin then the list will be
broken at every possible breaking point. The argument is the offset of the
block that {print_begin} initiates. This offset is added to the indentation
of any lines broken inside. This offset is virtually never used and should
preferably be avoided.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
\noindent The first step is to set the margin to be 13 characters wide:
{
   #set_margin 13;;
}
\noindent The second is to initialize the block using {print_begin}:
{
   #let  example =
      (print_newline();
       print_begin 0;
       print_string `first`;
       print_break (1,2);
       print_string `second`;
       print_break (1,2);
       print_string `third`;
       print_end();
       print_newline());;
}
\noindent After initialization of the block three strings `first',`second'
and `third' are printed each with a break between them. The total
width of the three strings is more than 13 (margin) but the first two (`first'
and `second') combined with the space between them is less than 13. From the
result of consistent formatting shown below it is clear that if any wrapping
takes place everything will be wrapped. To clearly
see what consistent breaking means contrast the above with {print_ibegin}
where the same example is used but with inconsistent formatting.

\noindent The output we obtain is the following:
{
   first
     second
     third
   example =
   ()
   : void
}

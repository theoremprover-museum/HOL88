\TYPE {load_theory : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads an existing theory into the system.

\DESCRIBE
A call {load_theory `thy`} loads the existing theory {thy} into the system
and makes it the current theory. The message `{Theory thy loaded}' is printed.
The theory is entered in proof mode. Whilst in this mode only theorems may be
added to the theory segment.

\FAILURE
A call to {load_theory `thy`} will fail if theory {thy} does not appear on
the current search path. It will fail if theory {thy} is not a descendant of
the current theory. It will fail if an ancestor of theory {thy} has been
extended with either new types or constants which clash with names in theory
{thy}. It will also fail if any of the theory files of the theory {thy}
have been damaged. On failure, the system recovers cleanly, unloading any
theory segments it had loaded before the failure was detected. It will diverge
if the theory hierarchy within theory {thy} contains loops, so that a theory
segment is its own ancestor.

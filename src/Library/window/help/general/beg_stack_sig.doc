\DESCRIBE
The signal {beg_stack_sig} is raised after a new stack is created.
The signal is raised with the name of the new stack.

When the window library is first loaded a handler is associated with this signal
that will print the window on top of the new stack.
Loading the xlabel component associates another handler with this signal
that sets the label on the xterminal in which HOL is running to the name
of the new stack.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\TYPE {add_weak : (thm -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Adds a weakening rule to the window system tables.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
The window inference system can compensate for a missing window rule
in its database by substituting a rule which preserves a relation which
is stronger than the one the user wanted to preserve.
To do this the system must know how to weaken a theorem where
two terms are related by the stronger relation to a theorem where the two
terms are related by the required relation.

The system already knows that equality is stronger than any reflexive relation,
and how to weaken a theorem which relates terms by equality to a theorem which
relates the terms by any reflexive relation.
Suppose you would like the system to know that the relation {"S"} is 
stronger than the relation {"R"}.
First you should define the following theorem:
{
   WEAK_SR |- !x y. (x S y) ==> (x R y)
}
\noindent Next you add this theorem with the command
{add_weak WEAK_SR}.
From this information system maintains lists of which relationships may be
substituted for which.
Suppose we had added to the system rules for weakening {"S"} to {"R"} and {"R"}
to {"Q"}, the system can infer that both {"R"} and {"S"} can be used as
substitutes for {"Q"}, but {"R"} is preferable since it is the weaker of the
two relations.

\FAILURE
{add_weak} will fail if you try to add a rule which duplicates information
already stored or inferred by the system.
{add_weak} will fail if you try to add a rule which would create a cycle
in the list of possible substitutes for a relation.
{add_weak} will fail if you try to add a rule which would create a branch
in the list of possible substitutes for a relation.

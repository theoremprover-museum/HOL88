\KEYWORDS
rule, quantifier, existential.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a variable {x} and a theorem {A |- t1 <== t2}, the
inference rule {EXISTS_PMI} returns the theorem {A |- (?x. t1) <== (?x. t2)},
provided {x} is not free in the assumptions.
{
         A |- t1 <== t2
   --------------------------  EXISTS_IMP "x"   [where x is not free in A]
    A |- (?x.t1) <== (?x.t2)
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem is a backward implication, or if the term is not a
variable, or if the term is a variable but is free in the assumption list.

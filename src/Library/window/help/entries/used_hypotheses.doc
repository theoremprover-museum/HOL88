\TYPE {used_hypotheses : (window -> term list)}

\SYNOPSIS
The used hypotheses of a window.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
Those hypotheses of a window that have actually been used in the transformation
of the window.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
The set returned by {used_hypotheses} for a given window need not be a
subset of the set returned by {hypotheses} for the same window.
This is because {used_hypotheses} will also contain any conjectures which
have been used in the transformation of the window.

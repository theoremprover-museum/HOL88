\TYPE {FILTER_PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_WIN : ((term -> bool) -> thm list -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrite the focus with selected terms of the context and a list of theorems.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{FILTER_PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_WIN p thms} rewrites the focus of the top
window of the current stack with {thms} and those theorems in the context of
the window, the conclusions of which satisfy the predicate {p}.

\FAILURE
Fails if there is no current stack.

{FILTER_PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_WIN p thms} will fail if the hypotheses of
any of the theorems in {thms} are not a subset of the conjectures of the window.

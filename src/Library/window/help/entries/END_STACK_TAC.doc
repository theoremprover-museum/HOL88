\DOC END_STACK_TAC

\TYPE {END_STACK_TAC : (string -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Closes a subwindow opened on the current goal of the subgoals package.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{END_STACK_TAC} name closes all the subwindows on the window stack called
{name} and returns to the parent window of the stack.
The theorem in this window is used to generate a theorem of the form
{(H |- goal' ==> goal)} where goal is the current goal of the subgoal package.
The current goal is transformed from {goal} to {goal'} and the named 
stacked ended.

\FAILURE
{END_STACK_TAC} will fail if you have done any other tactical reasoning
since opening the window with {BEGIN_STACK_TAC}.
{END_STACK_TAC} will also fail if there are any used conjectures in the 
current window.
{END_STACK_TAC} will fail if the named stack was not created with
{BEGIN_STACK_TAC}.

\EXAMPLE
{
   #set_goal ([], "A \/ (B \/ F)");;
   "A \/ B \/ F"
   
   () : void
   
   #e (BEGIN_STACK_TAC `tac` [RAND] []);;
   OK..
       ! ~A
   ==> * B \/ F
   "A \/ B \/ F"
   
   () : void
   
   #REWRITE_WIN [];;
       ! ~A
   ==> * B
   () : void
   
   #e (END_STACK_TAC `tac`);;
   OK..
   "A \/ B"
   
   () : void
}

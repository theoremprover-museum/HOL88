\TYPE {add_relation : ((thm # thm) -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Declares a new relation for use with the window system.

\DESCRIBE
Before the window inference system can be used to preserve a given relation,
the system must know that the relation is reflexive and transitive.
Initially the system knows about the reflexivity and transitivity of
equality, implication and backward implication.  To inform the system of the
reflexivity and transitivity of some new relation, {NEW}, the user should
first prove to new theorems {NEW_REFL_THM} and {NEW_TRANS_THM}.  These
theorems should have a form analogous to that of {IMP_REFL_THM} and
{IMP_TRANS_THM} respectively.  The user should then execute the following
command:

\noindent{
	add_relation (NEW_REFL_THM,NEW_TRANS_THM)
}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\TYPE {run_search : (searchstep -> foundthm list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Function to run a stepwise search to completion.

\LIBRARY trs

\DESCRIBE
A search can be run to completion using the function {run_search}. It takes a
step of a search as argument, and performs the remaining steps of the search.
The steps correspond to searches of individual theory segments. The result of
{run_search} is a list of all the theorems found during the entire search.

\FAILURE
The function may fail for a number of obscure reasons. Since the user may
supply his/her own side-condition functions at the beginning of the search, an
exhaustive list of possible failures cannot be given.

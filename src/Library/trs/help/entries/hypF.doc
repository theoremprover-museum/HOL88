\DESCRIBE
{hypF ts} returns a pattern that matches a theorem if and only if the
terms {ts}, when interpreted as patterns, match the hypotheses of the theorem.
Each term pattern must match to a distinct hypothesis, and all the hypotheses
must be matched. Variables in a term {t} match any term of a matching type.
Type variables in {t} match any type. If a variable or type variable occurs
more than once in the list {ts}, it must match to the same object at each
occurrence. If not, the match will not succeed.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

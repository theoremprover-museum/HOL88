\DESCRIBE
{thryname s} returns a pattern that matches a theorem if and only if the
string {s} when interpreted as a pattern for names matches the name of the
theory to which the theorem belongs. The string is used as a pattern in
which {*} is interpreted as `match any number of characters (including
none)' and {?} is interpreted as `match any single character'. All other
characters in the string are taken literally.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

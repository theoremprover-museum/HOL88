\TYPE {$has_body : (term -> term -> thmpattern)}

\SYNOPSIS
Side-condition test. Tests the value bound to a pattern variable to see if
its body matches a new pattern.

\DESCRIBE
{has_body} can be used to test whether part of a hypothesis or conclusion
has, as its body, a term that matches a specified pattern. The first argument
is a variable used in a pattern for the hypothesis/conclusion. Let {t} be the
term to which this variable has been bound. The second argument is the pattern
to be matched with the body of {t}. The body of a term, in this context, is
the result of stripping any binders from the front of the term.

\FAILURE
Fails if the first argument is not a variable. May also cause a failure to
match, when used in a search, if the pattern variable does not appear in the
binding.

\EXAMPLE
Here is a pattern that matches a theorem if the conclusion is an implication
in which the consequent has a conjunction as its body:
{
   (conc "p ==> q") Where ("q:bool" has_body "x /\ y")
}
\noindent Such a consequent is {"!a b c. a /\ (b \/ c)"}.

\TYPE {$Where : ((thmpattern # thmpattern) -> thmpattern)}

\SYNOPSIS
Generates a pattern that attempts a match, and if this is successful applies
a test to the resulting binding.

\DESCRIBE
{Where} is used for side-condition tests. Its first argument is a main clause.
The second argument is a side-condition clause and should only contain tests
on the bindings generated by the first argument. These tests may be combined
using the connectives {Andalso}, {Orelse} and {Not}.

{Where} should not occur within a side-condition clause. Strictly speaking,
side-condition tests should not be allowed to occur within a main clause.
However such an occurrence is interpreted as:
{
    (conc "conc:bool") Where (<side-condition test>)
}
\noindent This is only of use if the side-condition tests the binding of the
pattern variable {"conc"} (a term).

\FAILURE
Fails if the second argument is not a legal side-condition. A side-condition
can only contain tests on bindings, and the connectives {Andalso}, {Orelse}
and {Not}.

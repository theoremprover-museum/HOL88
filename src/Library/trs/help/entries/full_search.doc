\TYPE {full_search : (thmpattern -> source -> foundthm list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Function to perform a complete search.

\LIBRARY trs

\DESCRIBE
A search can be performed using the function {full_search}. It takes a pattern
and a source as arguments, and performs every step of the search without
pausing. If the source was a list of theorems there is only one step.
Otherwise, the steps correspond to searches of individual theory segments.
The result of {full_search} is a list of theorems found during the search.

\FAILURE
Fails if any theory segment in the source is not an ancestor of the current
theory segment. Also fails if a side-condition in the pattern attempts to test
the binding of a variable that does not occur in the main part of the pattern.
The function may fail for other similar reasons. Since the user may supply
his/her own side-condition functions, an exhaustive list of possible failures
cannot be given.

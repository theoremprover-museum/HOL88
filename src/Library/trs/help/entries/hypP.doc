\DESCRIBE
{hypP ts} returns a pattern that matches a theorem if and only if the
terms {ts}, when interpreted as patterns, match the hypotheses of the theorem.
Each term pattern must match to a distinct hypothesis, but if there are more
hypotheses than patterns, the match may still succeed. Variables in a term {t}
match any term of a matching type. Type variables in {t} match any type. If a
variable or type variable occurs more than once in the list {ts}, it must
match to the same object at each occurrence. If not, the match will not
succeed.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

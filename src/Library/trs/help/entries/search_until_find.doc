\TYPE {search_until_find : (searchstep -> searchstep)}

\SYNOPSIS
Function to continue a search until a matching theorem is found.

\LIBRARY trs

\DESCRIBE
{search_until_find} continues a search until a matching theorem is found. If
the list of theorems already found is non-empty the function does nothing.
{search_until_find} takes a step of a search as argument and returns a new
step.

\FAILURE
Fails if the steps are exhausted before a theorem is found. The function may
fail for other reasons. Since the user may supply his/her own side-condition
functions at the beginning of the search, an exhaustive list of possible
failures cannot be given.

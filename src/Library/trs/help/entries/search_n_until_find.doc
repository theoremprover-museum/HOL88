\DESCRIBE
{search_n_until_find} continues a search for a specified number of steps or
until a matching theorem is found. If the list of theorems already found is
non-empty the function does nothing. It takes an integer and a step
of a search as arguments, and returns a new step.

\FAILURE
Fails if the steps are exhausted before a theorem is found or the specified
number of steps have been completed. The function may fail for other reasons.
Since the user may supply his/her own side-condition functions at the
beginning of the search, an exhaustive list of possible failures cannot be
given.

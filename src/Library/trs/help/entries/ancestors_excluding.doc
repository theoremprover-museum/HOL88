\DESCRIBE
A {searchpath} is either a single theory segment, or it is a hierarchy of
theory segments. The latter is specified by two lists. The theory segments in
the second list and all of their ancestors will be searched in a breadth-first
manner. No theory segment will be searched more than once. The first list can
be used to specify exclusions. Any theory segment in the exclusion list or any
ancestors of those theory segments will not be searched unless they can be
reached by a route which does not go through a theory segment in the exclusion
list. A {searchpath} is generated by applying {ancestors_excluding} to the
two lists. The exclusion list is given first so that by making a partial
application a default exclusion list can be set up.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\TYPE {$contains : (term -> term -> thmpattern)}

\SYNOPSIS
Side-condition test. Tests the value bound to a pattern variable to see if
any part of it matches a new pattern.

\LIBRARY trs

\DESCRIBE
{contains} can be used to test whether part of a hypothesis or conclusion
contains a term, anywhere within it, that matches a pattern. Its first
argument is a variable used in a pattern for the hypothesis/conclusion. The
other argument is the pattern to be searched for within the term to which the
variable has been matched.

\FAILURE
Fails if the first argument is not a variable. May also cause a failure to
match, when used in a search, if the pattern variable does not appear in the
binding.

\EXAMPLE
Here is a pattern that matches a theorem if the conclusion is an equality in
which the right-hand side contains a conjunction.
{
   (conc "l = (r:*)") Where ("r:*" contains "x /\ y")
}

\TYPE {find_theorems : (thmpattern -> source -> searchstep)}

\SYNOPSIS
The main searching function. Performs the first step of a search.

\LIBRARY trs

\DESCRIBE
A search can be initiated using the function {find_theorems}. It takes a
pattern and a source as arguments, and performs the first step of the search.
If the source was a list of theorems there is only one step. Otherwise, the
steps correspond to searches of individual theory segments.

\FAILURE
Fails if any theory segment in the source is not an ancestor of the current
theory segment. Also fails if a side-condition in the pattern attempts to test
the binding of a variable that does not occur in the main part of the pattern.
The function may fail for other similar reasons. Since the user may supply
his/her own side-condition functions, an exhaustive list of possible failures
cannot be given.

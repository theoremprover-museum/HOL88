\DESCRIBE
{conc t} returns a pattern that matches a theorem if and only if the
term {t}, when interpreted as a pattern, matches the conclusion of the theorem.
Variables in {t} match any term of a matching type. Type variables in {t}
match any type. If a variable or type variable occurs more than once in {t},
it must match to the same object at each occurrence. If not, {t} will not
match the term.

\FAILURE
Never fails.
